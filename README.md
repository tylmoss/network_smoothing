# network_smoothing
Source code to build the R-package `network_smoothing` based upon the 
the network smoothing method in ['Network-based startification of tumor mutations`](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2651).
The functions here are a tranlasation of the [MatLab code](http://chianti.ucsd.edu/~mhofree/NBS/).
There is also a newer python port of the methods from the authors: [pyNBS](https://github.com/idekerlab/pyNBS).
